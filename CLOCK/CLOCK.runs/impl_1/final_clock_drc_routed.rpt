2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net State_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): State_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#2 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net mode_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): mode_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clock_chooser_0/inst/day_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock_chooser_0/inst/day_clk__0/O, cell clock_chooser_0/inst/day_clk__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clock_chooser_0/inst/hour_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock_chooser_0/inst/hour_clk__0/O, cell clock_chooser_0/inst/hour_clk__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clock_chooser_0/inst/min_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock_chooser_0/inst/min_clk__0/O, cell clock_chooser_0/inst/min_clk__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clock_chooser_0/inst/mon_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock_chooser_0/inst/mon_clk__0/O, cell clock_chooser_0/inst/mon_clk__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clock_chooser_0/inst/sec_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock_chooser_0/inst/sec_clk__0/O, cell clock_chooser_0/inst/sec_clk__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clock_chooser_0/inst/year_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clock_chooser_0/inst/year_clk__0/O, cell clock_chooser_0/inst/year_clk__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
